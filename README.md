# @nota/nativescript-accessibility-ext

Nativescript plugin for enabling accessibility features

## Reasoning behind this plugin:

NativeScript is a framework for developing cross-platform mobile applications.

NativeScript's support for platform specific accessibility features is very limited, as it only implements
those that can be abstracted for both platforms. So you have to enable these features in JavaScript-code
rather than in the template.

The goal of this plugin is to expose all platform-specific accessibility features for both Android and iOS through component properties.

It's heavily inspired by React-Native's accessibility API:
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility.html

But is written from scratch, extending NativeScript's classes.

## API:

Extends `tns-core-modules/ui/core/view` with these attributes and functions.

### Attributes and functions for both `iOS` and `Android`

#### Attribute: View.accessible (iOS, Android)

If `true` the element is an accessibility element and all the children will be treated as a single selectable component.

**CSS-property:** `a11y-enabled` = `true` / `false`

#### Attribute: View.accessibilityLabel (iOS, Android)

Set the accessibility label on the element, this will be read by the screen reader in-place in any 'text' value the element has.
Important note:
NativeScript provides the property automationText, this sets both `accessibilityLabel` AND `accessibilityIdentifier` on iOS which can break automated tests.
If you use `accessibilityLabel` from this plugin, DO NOT use `automationText` at the same time.

#### Attribute: View.accessibilityValue (iOS, Android)

Define the value of an accessibility element.

This is to give the user more information about the value of a field.
For instance a `Slider` would normally have a value between 0-100%, but if the Slider represents time, you can give the user better information about the value.

#### Attribute: View.accessibilityHint (iOS, Android)

Describes the result of performing an action on the view.

Should only be provided if the result isn't obvious from the label.

#### Attribute: View.accessibilityIdentifier (iOS, Android)

Set the elements unique accessibilityIdentifier.
Important note:
NativeScript provides the property automationText, this sets both `accessibilityLabel` AND `accessibilityIdentifier` on iOS which can break automated tests.
If you use this plugin, **DO NOT** use `automationText` at the same time.

#### Attribute: View.accessibilityHidden (iOS, Android)

Indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element are hidden.

Defaults to `false`.

**CSS-property:** `a11y-hidden` = `true` / `false`

#### Attribute: View.accessibilityRole (iOS, Android)

Defines the type of accessibility element, for example if something is a button.
This isn't needed for Nativescript Buttons, but used to make other elements behave like buttons.

### CSS-helper classes

- a11y-fontscale-xs-visible (iOS only - visible only when font size is extra small)
- a11y-fontscale-xs-hidden (iOS only - hidden when font size is extra small)
- a11y-fontscale-m-visible (visible only when font size is medium)
- a11y-fontscale-m-hidden (hidden when font size is medium)
- a11y-fontscale-xl-visible (iOS only - visible only when font size is extra large)

**Note:**

`Android` auto scale fonts on `Label` out of the box. But `iOS` does not.

To enabled support on `iOS`, you need to combine `@nativescript/theme` with our theme extension.

**Is TalkBack/VoiceOver enabled:***
- a11y-service-enabled (is VoiceOver/TalkBack enabled)
- a11y-service-disabled (is VoiceOver/TalkBack disabled)

#### To use the theme extension:

To use it all you need to do is add this to your `app.scss` / `app.css`:

```scss
@import '~@nativescript/theme/core.compat';
@import '~@nativescript/theme/scss/index';
@import url('~@nota/nativescript-accessibility-ext/a11y.css'); // <-- add this line
```

For compat mode:
```scss
@import '~@nativescript/theme/core.compat';
@import '~@nativescript/theme/scss/index';
@import url('~@nota/nativescript-accessibility-ext/a11y.compat.css'); // <-- add this line
```

| null | notificationType = 'layout': do nothing. notificationType = 'screen': auto selects, the first accessible element within this element will be given accessibility focus |

#### Attribute: Label.accessibilityAdjustsFontSize (iOS) DEPRECATED - use the theme instead.

Scales the font on a Label on iOS according to the settings in Settings -> General -> Accessibility -> Larger text
On Android this is handled automatically, on iOS you have to specify it yourself.
Note: It's similar to UILabel.adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory but affects all fonts not just the preferredFonts.
Note: Font Scale between 50% and 400%. 200% -> 400% are extra large accessibility font scaling

### Attribute: Slider.accessibilityStep (iOS)

Change the increment/decrement step size for the swipe `up` / `down` gesture.

Default step size is **10**

### Attributes and functions for `Android`-only

`msg` is an optional argument only used for `announcement`.
If not provided with `announcement` the elements `automationText` value will be announced instead.

#### The following are not implemented (yet)

- onAccessibilityTap (iOS)
- onMagicTap (iOS)

### Global events

Each built-in nativescript View-class is extended with global-events.

**Note:**
This conflicts with `nativescript-globalevents`-plugin.
If you for some reason need to load both modules, you need to import `nativescript-globalevents` before `@nota/nativescript-accessibility-ext`.

#### Adding a global-event

This event is added to every view-type.

```typescript
View.on(View.loadedEvent, (evt) => {
  const view = evt.object;
  // Do stuff.
});
```

This event is aded to all `Labels`

```typescript
Label.on(View.loadedEvent, (evt) => {
  const label = evt.object;
  // Do stuff.
});
```

#### Removing a global-event

Remove all global loaded events from the View-class.

```typescript
View.off(View.loadedEvent);
```

Remove a single global loaded event from the View-class.

```typescript
View.off(View.loadedEvent, callbackReference);
```

### Helpers:

#### FontScaleObservable

NativeScript Observable for getting the native fontScale on either platform.

**Note:**
Android: Font scale between 0.85 and 1.3 (85% -> 130%)
iOS: Font scale between 50% and 400%. 200% -> 400% are extra large accessibility font

## Installation

To use the plugin in your NativeScript-app, install and import the module:

```bash
npm i --save @nota/nativescript-accessibility-ext
```

### Special for Android

We support Android 19 and up, but the `compileSdkVersion` needs to be at least `29`.

Edit your `App_Resources/Android/app.gradle`:
```gradle
android {
  defaultConfig {
    minSdkVersion = 19 // <-- change this line
    compileSdkVersion = 29 // <-- change this line, if it exists.
    generatedDensities = []
  }
  aaptOptions {
    additionalParameters "--no-version-vectors"
  }
}
```

### For NativeScript Core

Change to your `app.ts`/`app.js`

```typescript
import * as app from 'tns-core-modules/application';
import '@nota/nativescript-accessibility-ext'; /// <-- Add this line

app.run({ moduleName: 'app-root' });
```

### For nativescript-angular

Change to your `app.module.ts`

```typescript
import { NgModule, NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA } from "@angular/core";
import { NativeScriptModule } from "nativescript-angular/nativescript.module";
import { NotaAccessibilityExtModule } '@nota/nativescript-accessibility-ext/angular'; /// <-- Add this line

/// ... stuff

@NgModule({
    bootstrap: [
        AppComponent
    ],
    imports: [
        NativeScriptModule,
        AppRoutingModule,
        NotaAccessibilityExtModule, /// <-- Add this line
    ],
    declarations: [
        AppComponent,
        ItemsComponent,
        ItemDetailComponent
    ],
    providers: [],
    schemas: [
        NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA
    ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

For more see [Angular](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Notalib/nativescript-accessibility-ext/master/src/Angular.md).

### For NativeScript Vue

Change to your `app.js`:

```javascript
import Vue from "nativescript-vue";
import '@nota/nativescript-accessibility-ext'; /// <-- Add this line

....
```

```typescript
import '@nota/nativescript-accessibility-ext';
```

Start adding the new properties to your templates:

```xml
<StackLayout
  accessible="true"
  automationText="This now a button"
  accessibilityComponentType="button"
  accessibilityTraits="button"
>
  <Label text="First button" (tap)="tapped($event)"></Label>
</StackLayout>
```
